# 👤 Live Age and Gender Detection with Streamlit + WebRTC

This is a real-time age and gender detection app built using **Streamlit**, **OpenCV**, **Keras**, and **streamlit-webrtc**. It captures live video from your webcam, detects faces, and predicts the age and gender of each detected person using a pre-trained deep learning model.
